# Git and some useful data science tricks

## Purpose

This project is intended to provide an introduction to Git and its use with an online repository, such as GitLab (or GitHub) for SANBI staff that are becoming familiar with the use of R, RStudio, Quarto and similar tools to create reproducible and shareable content. 
The content is very much limited to the basics of that context and there are many features and abilities of the software and platforms that are not mentioned or explored. 
It is also peppered with a few recommendations for keeping your workflows organised and conducive to collaboration and easing the path towards reproducible science.
Many of those suggestions are personal preferences that might be achieved in other ways.

## Getting started

To clone this repository,

  1.  Go to the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/nba_2025/git_tutorial).
  2.  Copy the relevant '*Clone with ...*' URL from the project page under the *Code* drop-down menu.
  3.  Within RStudio, create a new project (under *File* menu) and select *Version Control* and then *Git* to paste the copied URL. Ensure you're happy with the directory where the project will be saved before you hit *Create Project* (**hint: I tend to save all my R projects in one 'Rprojects' folder, so that it is easy to back them up and I always know where to find them.**)  
      
Once cloned, you can open the html files or the Quarto (*.qmd*) source files, both of which are in the *quarto* folder.
